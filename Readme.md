# Bank Kata

## Requirements
1. Write a class `Account` that offers the following methods:
    - void deposit(int) 
    - void withdraw(int) 
    - String printStatement()

2. You are not allowed to add any other method to this class.
3. Use strings and integers for dates and amounts
4. Don't worry about spacing in the printed on the console.

An example statement would be:

```
Date       | Amount  | Balance
10/06/2021 | 500.00  | 1400.00
02/06/2021 | -100.00 | 900.00
01/06/2021 | 1000.00 | 1000.00
```
